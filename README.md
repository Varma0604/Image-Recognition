Image Classification App
Overview
The Image Classification App utilizes TensorFlow.js and the MobileNet model to classify images uploaded by users. This web application provides an interactive interface for users to upload images and receive predictions about the content of those images.

Features
Upload images for classification.
Displays the predicted class and probability.
Responsive design suitable for various devices.
Technologies Used
HTML: Structure of the web application.
CSS: Styling and layout.
JavaScript: Functionality and interactivity.
TensorFlow.js: For running machine learning models in the browser.
MobileNet: Pre-trained model for image classification.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
How to Use
Clone the Repository

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-classification-app.git
cd image-classification-app
Open index.html

Open the index.html file in your web browser.
Upload an Image

Click on the "Choose File" button to upload an image.
Wait for the image to load and the model to classify it.
View Predictions

The application will display the predicted class and the probability of the prediction.
Code Explanation
Model Loading: The MobileNet model is loaded asynchronously when the app starts.
Image Upload: The user can upload an image, which is then displayed on the screen.
Image Classification: The uploaded image is resized to 224x224 pixels, processed, and classified using the MobileNet model.
Display Results: The predicted class and its probability are displayed below the image.
Customization
Feel free to modify the styles in the <style> section of the HTML or add additional features such as:

Support for multiple image uploads.
Displaying multiple predictions instead of just the top prediction.
